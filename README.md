# Pathfinding algorithms visualiser 

## Project description 

The project demonstrates the behavior of the following popular graph traversal algorithms in a 2D grid: 

- Dijkstra's algorithm 
- A* algorithm 
- Breadth-first-search 
- Depth-first-search 

The project also has the functionality to create random mazes using 2 different algorithms 


## Initialize and run the project  
```
npm install node_modules 
npm run start 
```
